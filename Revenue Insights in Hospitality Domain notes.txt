- understood metrics to be displayed on the dashboard
	- RevPAR: Revenue per available room (= total revenue/total available rooms)
	- % occupancy: (= total rooms sold/total available rooms)
	- ADR: Average daily rate (= total revenue/total rooms sold OR = revpar/% occupancy)
	- SRN: Sellable room nights
	- DSRN: Daily sellable room nights (=SRN/30 or 31)
	- Revenue
	- URN: Utilised room nights
	- BRN: Booked room nights (URN + no-shows + cancellations)
	- Realisation: URN/BRN
	- Weekend/Weekday split (Fri-Sat: weekends; Sun-Thurs: weekdays)
	- Business/Ledger split (Business: have more activity on weekdays; Ledger: have more activity on weekends)
	- weekly trends
	- Channel level split

	- hotels are not utilising dynamic pricing strategy as ADR is observed to be constant week-on-week despite changing RevPAR
	- hotels are not utilising dynamic weekday/weekend pricing strategy as ADR is observed to be nearly the same for weekday/weekend
	- hotels are not utilising channel-level pricing strategy as their direct offline ADR is higher than third-party platform ADR and direct online ADR is not as low as it can be (through direct channels, hotels can drop prices as they don't have to pay high commissions)
	- when we look at the 20% of the hotels causing 80% of the problems (Pareto Principle) for increasing business, we see that the hotel with lowest occupancy has low ratings as well as high cancellations; this shows that they could be struggling with providing good service
